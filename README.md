MacPaint is the drawing program application which interacts with the user, interprets mouse and keyboard requests,
and decides what is to be drawn where. The high-level logic is written in Apple Pascal, packaged in a single file with 5,822 lines. 
There are an additional 3,583 lines of code in assembler language for the underlying Motorola 68000 microprocessor, 
which implement routines needing high performance and some interfaces to the operating system.
